# Ad-Astra

Welcome to Ad Astra! This is a revolutionary web application which allows the filtering of different FITS images by metadata values, supplied by the NEOSSAT satellite. They enable one, of any age, to find images according to the filters they set. This solution is part of the Space Apps Hackathon 2019, CSA NEOSSat Challenge.
